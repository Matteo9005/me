# Matteo9005
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Matteo9005, an IT Technician and an aspiring System Administrator.

ðŸš€ In my free time, I enjoy programming for hobby projects and have a particular interest in web development (you can check out my portfolio [here](https://github.com/Matteo9005/matteo9005-template-portfolio)). While web development isnâ€™t my primary career goal, itâ€™s something Iâ€™m passionate about.

ðŸ‘¾ Fun fact: Iâ€™m an avid gamer! My favorite genres include FPS games like DOOM, Wolfenstein, and Titanfall 2, as well as platformers like Crash Bandicoot, Rayman Legends, Celeste, and Ori.
